        I have a couple of interests. Firstly sleeping is great. At times like these where you stay up to do overclocked work and wish you could be sleeping right makes sleeping feel better as a thought. When you're sleeping though you don't really feel anything so you don't really like it at that time. My point is sleeping is great and we should get less work.

        <span>I think I enjoy coding.</span> That's why I chose this major. I feel like this is something I could not procrastinate on since I want to see the end product of what I make. As I say this now I am procrastinating. Something that helps me get through procrastination is music. I enjoy listening to music as I feel like my phone is in use and I also am not sat in silence working on something.
