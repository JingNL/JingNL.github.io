    <paragraph>One place in <span>New York</span> I can recommend is Coney Island. I remember going there as a kid and having a lot of fun on the rides they let me on. One bad thing about the place is that they discriminate against children and short people for rides with a height requirement which is kind of based. Other than that it's fun to go with family.</paragraph>
    <p>There are a lot of places you shouldn't go in New York City. If you go around the place you'll find out that the smell of sewer water is commonplace and you'll find a Ratatouille vs. Stuart Little wrestling match free of charge in certain spots. The whole place is dirty and the subway also stinks of sewage as well. The underground rat battles I would pay to see though.</p>
