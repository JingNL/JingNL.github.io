    <paragraph>I'm no <span>good</span> at teaching anything but when it comes down to computing the science I think I know stuff from one Junior school year of learning Java. I hope I do. Java is an object-oriented language that allows you to do many things. These many things being anything you can think of probably. That is the end of my tutorial. I think I forgot how to Java</paragraph>
    <p>Something useless I know for the real world that I know is how to battle in Pokemon. I don't know why I have never picked up a Pokemon game. The first step when it comes to battling is teambuilding. The teambuilding revolves around the metagame you're deciding on playing whether it's doubles or singles. There's monotype, national dex, and standard other generations as well with the current gen 9 being the popular one right now. There's also different types of teams you can build depending on your playstyle. You can play hyper offensive, use a stall team, or have a balance team instead. I like to build a team around a good defensive core in order to have an easier time. I can go on about EV spreads, when you want 0 IVs and all of that but I'm getting tired of this.</p>
